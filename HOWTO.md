## Transfer file from desktop to ev3dev robot
If you want to move files from your desktop to the robot:
1. Find the robot IP address on the top left side of the ev3dev robot.
2. SSH to the robot [via USB cable](http://www.ev3dev.org/docs/tutorials/connecting-to-ev3dev-with-ssh/) or [via Wi-Fi](WirelessSetup.md)
3. Open another terminal, and run ***scp /path/to/file robot@robot's IP address:/path/to/destination***
4. Put the password when asked; default password is **maker**
5. If you want to execute the files from the robot directly without SSH, run ***chmod +x /path/to/file*** when you are connected to the robot through SSH

## Establishing a Client-Server connection between robot and computer
1. Make sure you have the following files on the **computer**. They should be in the same folder. They are located 
on this repository in the [server](/server) folder.
* **SocketServer.py** - The "server" script
* **writeCSV.py** - Used to write data to a CSV file
* **Constant.py** - Holds important shared constants between client and server machines

2. Make sure you have the following Python files on the **robot**. They should be in the same folder. They are located 
on this repository in the [client](/client) folder
* **SocketClient.py** - The "client" script
* **Ev3devSetup.py** - Additional stuff to setup ev3dev robot sensors and motors
* **Constant.py** - Holds important shared constants between client and server machines
* **stopmotors.sh** - A bash script to stop motors in the event that they do not stop

3. Execute the **SocketServer.py** script in terminal. Use Python 3. (**python3 SocketServer.py**)
4. Execute the **SocketClient.py** script. There are two main ways to execute the **SocketClient.py**:
* **Via SSH** - SSH to the robot, navigate to where **SocketClient.py** is located and execute it. Use Python 3.
* **Via the robot itself** - Using the Mindstorms brick screen, you should be able to navigate through the file system on the robot. Execute the file by selecting **SocketClient.py**.

5. If the connection is successful, you should see something like this in the terminal:
![Server-Running](/res/howto1.png)

Select an option from the printed menu by pressing the corresponding number on your keyboard. For example, press '1' on your keyboard to select **Keyboard** mode.
* **Keyboard** - Allows the user to control the robot movements with WASD controls. (Requires your cursor to be in the terminal window while running)
* **Braitenburg** - Represents a Braitenburg machine
* **Random** - Random movements by the robot

6. After you have selected an option, you should see values being continuously printed on the terminal as shown below:
![Server-Result](/res/howto2.png)
* **ls** - Left light sensor value
* **rs** - Right light sensor value
* **luv** - Left ultrasound sensor value
* **ruv** - Right ultrasound sensor value
* **lm** - Left motor speed
* **rm** - Right motor speed

7. To quit, press **q** on your keyboard at any point in time. The **SocketServer.py** script should terminate on the server side, and the **SocketClient.py** script on the robot should terminate automatically.

**Note:** If the program has successfully terminated but the robot continues to move, execute the **./stopmotors.sh** bash script on the robot to force the motors to stop. This can be done through SSH or directly on the robot itself.
**THIS IS A BUG**
